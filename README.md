# ‚úèÔ∏è Questions that you might want to address about the given data

## In this code we know hopw much avalaibe and un avaliable room
```python
df.available.value_counts()
```
<img width="1013" alt="Screenshot 1446-07-22 at 11 49 11‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fe58ae8-88e5-4467-add9-b45c54bbd2e3" />

* f (false) means not available, t(true) means available.

## We calculate the percentage of avaliable and unavaliable room
```‚Å†python
avi_per = df['available'].value_counts(normalize = True)*100
avi_per
```

* f (false) means not available, t(true) means available.

## Counts for the busiest day!

```python
bus_day = df[df['available']== 'f']['date'].value_counts()
bus_day.head()
```

##  üìà Plot a bar graph to show availability percentage
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
avi_per.plot(kind='bar', color=['blue', 'pink'])
plt.title('Availability Percentages')
plt.ylabel('Percentage')
plt.xlabel('Available (t/f)')
plt.show()

## üìà Plot the busiest day

```python
bus_day.head(10).plot(kind='bar', color='lightblue')
plt.title('Top 10 Busiest Dates')
plt.ylabel('Number of Listings Unavailable')

## üìå Let us see the listings on a real map
#### Hotter Areas (Red/Yellow) in Barcelona:
* High Density:
Areas highlighted in red or yellow (the "hot" colors) indicate a higher concentration of listings. This means there are many available rental properties in these parts of the city.
* Popular Locations:
These regions are likely in high demand, often near major attractions such as La Rambla, Sagrada Fam√≠lia, the Gothic Quarter, or Barceloneta Beach. These are the areas where tourists and visitors tend to stay the most.
#### Colder Areas (Green/Blue) in Barcelona:
* Low Density:
The blue or green (the "cold" colors) indicate a lower concentration of listings, meaning fewer rental properties are available in these zones.
* Less Popular Locations:
These areas might be farther from the main tourist hotspots, often located in quieter residential neighborhoods like Horta-Guinard√≥ or Sant Andreu. Lower density could also suggest more affordable stays due to less competition.
#### Density Patterns in Barcelona:
* Clustered Areas:
If you see clusters of heatmap intensity, these hotspots likely correspond to busy locations such as Passeig de Gr√†cia, Pla√ßa de Catalunya, or areas near Camp Nou, where visitor activity is high.
* Spread-Out Listings:
A more even spread of listings across Barcelona could indicate that demand is balanced, with travelers booking stays across different neighborhoods rather than just the central areas.

```python
import folium
from folium.plugins import HeatMap
import pandas as pd


Barcelona_data = listings[['latitude', 'longitude', 'price']]  # Example, you may add more columns

# Create a base map centered around Hawaii
a = folium.Map(location=[41.403763895076544, 2.2017716019349334], zoom_start=10)

# Prepare the data for the heatmap
heat_data = [[row['latitude'], row['longitude']] for index, row in Barcelona_data.iterrows()]

# Add the heatmap to the map
HeatMap(heat_data).add_to(a)

# Save the map as an HTML file to view in a browser
a.save('Barcelona_heatmap.html')

# If you're using Jupyter Notebook, you can display the map directly in the notebook:

## üîçÔ∏è Question 1: What is the proportion of listings with more than 100 reviews?
```python
# Count listings with more than 100 reviews
highly_reviewed_listings_count = listings[listings["number_of_reviews"] > 100].shape[0]

# Plot the result
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
labels = ["Listings with >100 Reviews", "Other Listings"]
sizes = [highly_reviewed_listings_count, listings.shape[0] - highly_reviewed_listings_count]
colors = ["lightcoral", "lightgray"]
plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct="%1.1f%%", colors=colors, startangle=140, wedgeprops={"edgecolor": "black"})

plt.title("Proportion of Listings with More than 100 Reviews", fontsize=14)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

## üîçÔ∏è Question 2: Find the top 10 neighbourhoods with the most listings available all year (365 days)
```python
# Find the top 10 neighbourhoods with the most listings available all year (365 days)
top_neighbourhoods_availability = listings[listings["availability_365"] == 365]["neighbourhood"].value_counts().head(10)

# Plot the result
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
top_neighbourhoods_availability.plot(kind="bar", color="lightpink", edgecolor="black")

plt.title("Top 5 Neighbourhoods with Listings Available All Year", fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel("Neighbourhood", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Number of Listings", fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", alpha=0.7)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
